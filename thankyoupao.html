    <div class="message-box">
        <p>I just want to take a moment to really appreciate you for everything you've done and for sticking around through it all. You have been there in ways that words can't fully capture, always steady and present, even when things got overwhelming. It's not every day you meet someone who truly understands you and chooses to stay, even when things aren't perfect. You have proven to me, time and time again, that you are someone I can rely on, no matter what. I don't say it enough, but I see everything you do, and I am beyond grateful for the person you are in my life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
        <p>You've seen sides of me that not everyone gets to see, both the good and the not-so-good, and yet you've never walked away. That kind of loyalty and understanding is rare, and I can't tell you how much it means to me. You've held my heart with such gentleness, helping me get better when I couldn't do it myself. Even when I was caught up in my own chaos, you remained calm and supportive, always knowing exactly how to ground me. I don't think I've ever properly expressed how much I value that. You make everything feel more manageable, even when it feels overwhelming. I know I failed my part in showing you that same care before, but I want you to know that I'm committed to doing better now. I'll make sure to be there for you in the same way you've always been there for me. You make life feel a little less heavy, and I'll never take that for granted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="message-box">
        <p>I know I messed up before and did not show your efforts the way I should have. It's that simple, and I couldn't do it back then. I realize now how much that hurt, and I am really sorry for making you feel like your efforts were unseen. You've made such a big impact on me, even if it took me learning the hard way. After our conversation, I realized how my actions put you through, and I can only imagine how pathetic that made you feel. I want you to know I'm taking full responsibility for it, and I won't let you down moving forward. I will show you the same care and respect you've always given me, because you deserve nothing less.</div>

    <div class="message-box">
        <p>I know I've messed up a lot, and I've caused you to feel drained and exhausted. Thank you for giving me another chance to prove that I can do better, so we can break this cycle and move forward together. I won't take this for granted, and I'll do my best to show you that I'm committed to making things right.</p>
